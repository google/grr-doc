GRR Docker Image
================

The GRR Docker image is is currently intended for
evaluation/testing use, but the plan is to support simple cloud deployment of a
stable production image in the future.

The instructions below get you a recent stable docker image. We also build an image
link:https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/grrdocker/grr/[automatically from
the latest commit in the github] repository which is more up-to-date but isn't guaranteed to work. If you want bleeding edge you can use `grrdocker/grr:latest` in the commands below.

How to use the image
--------------------

----
docker run \
--name grr-server
-e EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME="localhost" \
-e ADMIN_PASSWORD="demo" \
--ulimit nofile=1048576:1048576 \
-p 0.0.0.0:8000:8000 -p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080 \
grrdocker/grr:v3.2.0.1 grr
----

Once initialization finishes point your web browser to localhost:8000 and login
with admin:demo. Follow the final part of the quickstart instructions to
link:https://github.com/google/grr-doc/blob/master/quickstart.adoc#install-the-clients[download
and install the clients].

- EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME is the hostname you want GRR agents (clients) to poll back
  to, “localhost” is only useful for testing.
- ADMIN_PASSWORD is the password for the “admin” user in the webui.
- ulimit makes sure the container doesn't run out of filehandles, which is
  important for the sharded SQLite DB.
- The container will listen on port 8000 for the admin web UI and port 8080 for
  client polls

If you would like the database and logs to persist longer than the life of the
container you could use something like (this also adds -d to run it as a
daemon):

----
mkdir ~/grr-docker
docker run \
--name grr-server -v ~/grr-docker/db:/var/grr-datastore \
-v ~/grr-docker/logs:/var/log \
-e EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME="localhost" \
-e ADMIN_PASSWORD="demo" \
--ulimit nofile=1048576:1048576 \
-p 0.0.0.0:8000:8000 -p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080 \
-d grrdocker/grr:v3.2.0.1 grr
----

Note that if you're running boot2docker on OS X there are a few bugs
link:https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/824[with docker itself]
that you will probably need to workaround. You'll likely have to set up port
forwards for 8000 and 8080 as described
link:https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/blob/master/doc/WORKAROUNDS.md[here].

Running GRR binaries in the Docker container
--------------------------------------------

When using Docker, GRR gets installed into a virtualenv in `/usr/share/grr-server`. Thus, the easiest way to run any of the GRR binaries inside the Docker container is to activate the virtualenv:

```
source /usr/share/grr-server/bin/activate
```

After that, commands such as `grr_server`, `grr_config_updater`, `grr_console`, `grr_client`, etc become available on PATH.
