GRR Administrator Documentation
===============================
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble
:icons:

This document is intended for administrators who wish to deploy and manage GRR
in an enterprise. It is also applicable for anyone who wants to try it out.

Deploying the GRR server.
-------------------------

Get a GRR server installed and running in a few minutes with the
link:quickstart.adoc[quickstart install]. If you're building a dev server take a look at the link:https://github.com/google/grr-doc/blob/master/installfrompip.adoc[pip install instructions].

Client and Server Version Compatibility and Numbering
-----------------------------------------------------

We try hard to avoid breaking backwards compatibility for clients since upgrading can be painful, but occasionally we need to make changes that require a new client version to work. As a general rule you want to upgrade the server first, then upgrade the clients fairly soon after.

Matching major/minor versions of client and server should work well together. i.e. Clients 3.1.0.0 and 3.1.6.2 should work well with servers 3.1.0.0 and 3.1.9.7 because they are all 3.1 series. We introduced this approach for the 3.1.0.0 release.

For older servers and clients, matching the last digit provided similar guarantees. i.e. client 3.0.0.7 was released with server 0.3.0-7 and should work well together.

Key Management
--------------

GRR requires multiple key pairs. These are used to:

- Sign the client certificates for enrollment.
- Sign and decrypt messages from the client.
- Sign code and drivers sent to the client.

These keys can be generated using the config_updater script normally installed
in the path as grr_config_updater using the generate_keys command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

To Encrypt and add a password to the code & driver signing certificates

1. Copy the keys (PrivateKeys.executable_signing_private_key & PrivateKeys.driver_signing_private_key) from the current GRR configuration file (whichever you’re using)
 
 - /etc/grr/grr-server.yaml
 - /etc/grr/server.local.yaml

2. Save these two keys as new text files temporarily. You’ll need to convert the key text to the normal format by removing the leading whitespace and blank lines:

 cat <original.exe.private.key.txt> | sed 's/^  //g' | sed '/^$/d' > <clean.exe.private.key>
 cat <original.driver.private.key.txt> | sed 's/^  //g' | sed '/^$/d' > <clean.driver.private.key>

3. Encrypt key & add password

 openssl rsa -des3 -in <clean.exe.private.key.txt> -out <exe.private.secure.key>
 openssl rsa -des3 -in <clean.driver.private.key.txt> -out <driver.private.secure.key>

4. Securely wipe all temporary files with cleartext keys. 

5. Replace the keys in the GRR config with the new encrypted keys (or store them offline) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PrivateKeys.executable_signing_private_key: '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
 
   Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
  
   DEK-Info: DES-EDE3-CBC,8EDA740783B7563C
  
  
   <start key text after *two* blank lines…>
  
   <KEY...>
  
   -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: In the YAML encoding,there *must* be an extra line between the encrypted PEM header
and the encoded key. The key is double-spaces and indented two spaced exactly like all other
keys in configuration file. 

Alternatively, you can also keep your new, protected keys in files on the server and load
them in the configuration using the file filter like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PrivateKeys.executable_signing_private_key: %(<path_to_keyfile>|file)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


User Management
---------------

GRR has a concept of users of the system. The GUI supports authentication and
this verfication of user identity is used in all auditing functions (So for
example GRR can properly record which user accessed which client, and who
executed flows on clients).

Users are modeled in the data store as AFF4 objects called GRRUser. These
normally reside in the directory 'aff4:/users/<username>'. To manage users it is
possible to use the config_updater.py script:

To add the user joe as an admin:
[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
db@host:~$ sudo grr_config_updater add_user joe
Using configuration <ConfigFileParser filename="/etc/grr/grr-server.conf">
Please enter password for user 'joe':
Updating user joe

Username: joe
Labels:
Password: set
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To list all users:
[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
db@host:~$ sudo grr_config_updater show_user
Using configuration <ConfigFileParser filename="/etc/grr/grr-server.conf">

Username: test
Labels:
Password: set

Username: admin
Labels: admin
Password: set
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To update a user (useful for setting labels or for changing passwords):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
db@host:~$ sudo grr_config_updater update_user joe --add_labels admin,user
Using configuration <ConfigFileParser filename="/etc/grr/grr-server.conf">
Updating user joe

Username: joe
Labels: admin,user
Password: set
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security Managers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GRR supports the ideas of a Security Manager. The Security Manager
(Datastore.security_manager config option) handles authorizing those users to
resources based on a set of rules.

The default Security Manager is the BasicAccessControlManager. This manager
provides rudimentary Admin/Non-Admin functionality, but very little else. See
the Auditing section for a discussion on the FullAccessControlManager.


Authentication to the Admin UI.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AdminUI uses basic authentication by default, based on the passwords within
the user objects stored in the data store, but we _don't expect you to use this
in production_. There is so much diversity and customization in enterprise
authentication shemes that there isn't a good way to provide a solution that
works for a majority of users. But you probably already have internal webapps
that use authentication, this is just one more. Most people have found the
easiest approach is to sit Apache (or similar) in front of the GRR Admin UI as
a reverse proxy and use an existing SSO plugin that already works for that
platform. Alternatively, with more work you can handle auth inside GRR by
writing a Webauth Manager (AdminUI.webauth_manager config option) that uses an
SSO or SAML based authentication mechanism.

Email Configuration
-------------------
This section assumes you have already installed an MTA, such as link:http://www.postfix.org/[Postfix] or link:http://untroubled.org/nullmailer/[nullmailer].  After you have successfully tested your mail transfer agent, please proceed to the steps outlined below. 

To configure GRR to send emails for reports or other purposes:

Ensure email settings are correct by running back through the configuration script if needed (or by checking /etc/grr/server.local.yaml):

-----------------------------
grr_config_updater initialize
-----------------------------

Edit /etc/grr/server.local.yaml to include the following at the end of the file:

----------------------------------
Worker.smtp_server: <server>
Worker.smpt_port: <port>
----------------------------------
and, if needed,

----------------------------------
Worker.smtp_starttls: True
Worker.smtp_user: <user>
Worker.smtp_password: <password>
----------------------------------

After configuration is complete, restart the GRR worker(s).  You can test this configuration by running a ClientListReport Flow (Start Global Flows > Reporting > RunReport).

Security Considerations
-----------------------

Because GRR is designed to be deployed on the Internet and provides very
valuable functionality to an attacker, it comes with a number of security
considerations to think about before deployment. This section will cover the key
security mechanisms and the options you have.

Communication Security.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GRR communication happens using signed and encrypted protobuf messages. We use
1024 bit RSA keys to protect symmetric AES256 encryption. The security of the
system does not rely on SSL transport for communication security. This enables
easy replacement of the comms protocol with non-http mechanisms such as UDP
packets.

The communications use a CA and server public key pair generated on server
install. The CA public key is deployed to the client so that it can ensure it
is communicating with the correct server. If these keys are not kept secure,
anyone with MITM capability can intercept communications and take control of
your clients. Additionally, if you lose these keys, you lose the ability to
communicate with your clients.

Full details of this protocol and the security properties can be found in the
link:implementation.adoc[Implementation document].


Driver, Code Signing and CA Keys.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In addition to the CA and Server key pairs, GRR maintains a set of code
signing and driver signing keys.
By default GRR aims to provide only read-only actions, this means that GRR is
unlikely to modify evidence, and cannot trivially be used to take control of
systems running the agent footnote:[Read only access many not give direct code
exec, but may well provide it indirectly via read access to important keys and
passwords on disk or in memory.].
However, there are a number of use cases where it makes sense to have GRR
execute arbitrary code as explained in the section 
link:#deploying-custom-drivers-and-code[Deploying Custom Drivers and Code].

As part of the GRR design, we decided that administrative control of
the GRR server shouldn't trivially lead to code execution on the clients. As
such we embed a strict 
link:https://github.com/google/grr/search?q=IsExecutionWhitelisted[whitelist of commands] 
that can be executed on the client and we have a separate set of keys for
driver signing and code signing. For a driver to be loaded, or binary to be
run the code has to be signed by the specific key, the client will confirm
this signature before execution.

This mechanism helps give the separation of control required in some deployments. 
For example, the Incident Response team need to analyze hosts to get their job
done, but deployment of new code to the platfrom is only done when blessed by
the administrators and rolled out as part of standard change control. 
The signing mechanism allows Incident Response to react fast with new code if
necessary, but only with the blessing of the Signing Key held by the platform
administrator. 

In the default install, the driver and code signing private keys are not
passphrase protected. In a secure environment we strongly recommended
generating and storing these keys off the GRR server and doing offline
signing every time this functionality is required, or at a minimum setting
passphrases which are required on every use. We recommend encrypting the
keys in the config with PEM encryption, config_updater will then ask for
the passphrase when they are used. An alternative is to keep a separate
offline config that contains the private keys. 


Agent Protection.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The open source agent does not contain protection against being disabled by
administrator/root on the machine. E.g. on Windows, if an attacker stops the
service, the agent will stop and will no longer be reachable.
Currently, it is up to the deployer of GRR to provide more protection for the
service.

Obfuscation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If every deployment in the world is running from the same location and the
same code, e.g. c:\program files\grr\grr.exe, it becomes a pretty obvious
thing for an attacker to look for and disable. Luckily the attacker has the
same problem an investigator has in finding malware on a system, and we can
use the same techniques to protect the client.
One of the key benefits of having an open architecture is that customization
of the client and server is easy, and completely within your control.

For a test, or low security deployment, using the defaults open source agents
is fine. However, in a secure environment we strongly recommend using some
form of obfuscation.

This can come in many forms, but to give some examples:

- Changing service, and binary names
- Changing registry keys
- Obfuscating the underlying python code
- Using a packer to obfuscate the resulting binary
- Implementing advanced protective or obfuscation functionality such as those
 used in rootkits
- Implementing watchers to monitor for failure of the client

GRR does not include any obfuscation mechanisms by default. But we attempt to
make this relatively easy by controlling the build process through the
configuration file.

Enrollment.
~~~~~~~~~~
In the default setup, clients can register to the GRR server with no prior
knowledge. This means that anyone who has a copy of the GRR agent, and knows
the address of your GRR server can register their client to your deployment.
This significantly eases deployment, and is generally considered low risk as
the client has no control or trust on the server.

However, it does introduce some risk, in particular:

- If there are flows or hunts you deploy to the entire fleet, a malicious
  client may receive them. These could give away information about what you are
  searching for.
- Clients are allowed to send some limited messages to the server without
  prompting, these are called Well Known flows. By default these can be used
  to send log messages, or errors. A malicious client using these could fill up
  logs and disk space.
- If you have custom Well Known Flows that perform interesting actions. You need
  to be aware that untrusted clients can call them. Most often this could result
  in a DoS condition, e.g. through a client sending multiple install failure or
  client crash messages.

In many environments this risk is unwarranted, so we suggest implementing
further authorization in the Enrollment Flow using some information that only
your client knows, to authenticate it before allowing it to become a
registered client.

Note that this does not give someone the ability to overwrite data from
another client, as client name collisions are protected.

Server Security.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The http server is designed to be exposed to the Internet, but there is no
reason for the other components in the GRR system to be.

The Administration UI by default listens on all interfaces, and is protected by
only basic authentication configured via the --htpasswd parameter. We strongly
recommend putting the UI on SSL and IP limiting the clients that can connect.
The best way to do this normally is by hosting it inside Apache via wsgi,
using Apache to provide the SSL and other protection measures.

Auditing.
~~~~~~~~~
By default GRR currently only offers limited audit logs in the /var/log/
directory. However, the system is designed to allow for deployment of extensive
auditing capabilities through the Security Manager and through the API router.

The idea is that we have a gateway process, and the Admin UI and any console
access is brokered through the gateway. The gateway is the only access to the
datastore and it audits all access and can provide intelligent access control.
This is implemented in the FullAccessControlManager.

Admin UI API handlers, though, are relying on unrestricted access to the
datastore, so effectively FullAccessControlManager is not used when HTTP
API calls are handled. So it's also necessary to set API.DefaultRouter to
an API router that will be doing necessary access checks.

Using this allows for sensible access control, e.g. another user must authorize
access before someone is given access to a machine, or an admin must authorize
before a hunt is run.

In order to enable full access control, add 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AdminUI Context:
  Datastore.security_manager: FullAccessControlManager
  API.DefaultRouter: ApiCallRouterWithApprovalChecksWithoutRobotAccess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to your configuration. Note that GRR will try to send approval emails so you
also need to set up email domain / SMTP server / ...


Enabling SSL on the AdminUI.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The AdminUI supports SSL if it is configured. We don't currently generate
certs to enable this by default as certificate management is messy, but you
can enable by adding to your config something like:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AdminUI.enable_ssl: True
AdminUI.ssl_cert_file: "/etc/ssl/certs/grr.crt"
AdminUI.ssl_key_file: "/etc/ssl/private/grr.plain.key"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that SSL performance using this method may be average. If you have a lot
of users and a single AdminUI, you may get better performance putting GRR behind
an SSL reverse proxy such as Apache and letting it handle the SSL.


GRR Security Checklist.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.For all deployments
- Generate new CA/server keys on initial install. Back up these keys somewhere
securely.
- Ensure the GRR Administrative UI interface is not exposed to the Internet
and is protected.

.For a high security environment
- Introduce controls on enrollment to protect the server from unauthorized
clients.
- Produce obfuscated clients.
- Regenerate code and driver signing keys with passphrases.
- Run the http server serving clients on a separate machine to the workers.
- Introduce a stronger AdminUI sign in mechanism and use the
FullAccessControlManager.
- Ensure the Administrative UI is SSL protected
- Ensure the database server is using strong passwords and is well protected.


Managing the Datastore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GRR currently ships with a sharded SQLite datatbase that is used by default, and a MySQL Advanced datastore that may be a better choice if you have significant in-house MySQL experience and resources.

Performance
-----------

GRR is designed to scale linearly, but performance depends significantly on the datastore
implementation, how it is being run, and the hardware it is running on.

Large Scale Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:implementation.adoc#grr-component-overview[GRR server components] should be distributed across multiple machines in any deployment where you expect to have more than a few hundred clients, or even smaller deployments if you plan on doing intensive hunting. The performance needs of the various components are discussed link:component-performance-needs[below], and some real-world example deployment configurations are link:faq.adoc#what-hardware-do-i-need-to-run-grr[described in the FAQ].

You should install the GRR package on all machines and use configuration management (chef, puppet etc.) to:

 - Distribute the same grr-server.yaml to each machine
 - Control how many of each component to run on each machine (see next section for details)
 
Running Multiple Copies of Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
For 3.1.0 and later, use a link:http://askubuntu.com/questions/659267/how-do-i-override-or-configure-systemd-services[systemd drop-in override] to control how many copies of each component you run on each machine. This can initially be done using:
 
----
sudo systemctl edit grr-server
----
 
which creates "/etc/systemd/system/grr-server.service.d/override.conf". You'll want to turn this into a template file and control via puppet or similar. An example override that just runs 3 workers looks like:
 
----
[Service]
ExecReload=
ExecReload=/bin/systemctl --no-block reload grr-server@worker.service grr-server@worker2.service grr-server@worker3.service
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/bin/systemctl --no-block start grr-server@worker.service grr-server@worker2.service grr-server@worker3.service
ExecStop=
ExecStop=/bin/systemctl --no-block stop grr-server@worker.service grr-server@worker2.service grr-server@worker3.service
----
 
When starting multiple copies of the UI and the web frontend you also need to tell GRR which ports it should be using. So if you want 10 http frontends on a machine you would configure your systemd drop-in to start 10 copies and then set Frontend.port_max so that you have a range of 10 ports from Frontend.bind_port. You can then configure your load balancer to distribute across that port range. AdminUI.port_max works the same way for the UI.
 
Prior to 3.1.0 the approach was to use config management tools to:
 
 - Manipulate the /etc/default/grr-* files to enable the relevant services you want to run on each machine
 - Create new init scripts for components that should have multiple instances on each machine. e.g. If you want to run 20 workers you'd set up a puppet template to create 19 extra /etc/init/grr-worker[1-19].conf files. This will get easier when we have a docker cloud deployment, which is naturally suited to standing up many copies of services.
 
Component Performance Needs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- *Worker*: you will probably want to run more than one worker. In a large
  deployment where you are running numerous hunts it makes sense to run 20+
  workers. As long as the datastore scales, the more workers you have the faster
  things get done. We previously had a config setting that forked worker processes off, but this turned out to play badly with datastore connection pools, the stats store, and monitoring ports so it was removed.
- *HTTP frontend*: The frontend http server can be a significant bottleneck. By default we
  ship with a simple http server, but this is single process, written in python
  which means it may have thread lock issues. To get better performance you will
  need to run the http server with the wsgi_server in the tools directory from
  inside a faster web server such as Apache. See section below for how. As well as having a better performing http server, if you are moving a lot of
  traffic you probably want to run multiple http servers. Again, assuming your
  datastore handles it, these should scale linearly.
- *Web UI*: The admin UI component is usually under light load, but you can run as many as you want for redundancy. The more concurrent GRR users you have, the more instances you need. This is also the API server, so if you intend to use the API heavily run more.

Performance-Critical Client Config Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- *Foreman check frequency*: By default the foreman_check_frequency in the client
  configuration is set to 1 hr. This variable controls how often a client
  checks if there are hunts scheduled for it. Increasing this number slows down how fast a hunt ramps up, which
  normalizes the load at the cost of making the hunt slower (this is useful in
  large deployments). Decreasing this number means clients pick up hunts sooner, but each foreman check incurs a penalty on the frontend server, as it must queue up a check against the rules.

Datastore Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not CPU bound on the individual components (workers, http server)
then the key performance differentiator will be the datastore. Significant performance improvement work has been done on the MySQL Advanced and SQLite datastores but more can still be done. Improvements here will yield large gains, pull requests welcome :)

Running the GRR HTTP Server In Apache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TBD. User contributions welcome.
Using the wsgi hasn't been thoroughly tested. If you test, please send feedback
to the dev list and we can try and fix things.

Running the GRR HTTP Server Behind Apache Reverse Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running apache as a reverse proxy in front of the GRR admin UI is a good way to provide SSL protection for the UI traffic and also integrate with corporate single sign on (if available), for authentication.

Buy an SSL certificate, or generate a self-signed one if you're only testing.

Place the public key into “/etc/ssl/certs/“ and ensure it’s world readable

-----------------------------------------
chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/grr_ssl_certificate_filename.crt
-----------------------------------------

Place the private key into “/etc/ssl/private” and ensure it is *NOT* world readable

-----------------------------------------
chmod 400 /etc/ssl/private/grr_ssl_certificate_filename.key
-----------------------------------------

Install apache2 and required modules

-----------------------------------------
apt-get install apache2
a2enmod proxy
a2enmod ssl
a2enmod proxy_http
-----------------------------------------

Disable any default apache files currently enabled (probably 000-default.conf, but check for others that may interfere with GRR)

-----------------------------------------
a2dissite 000-default
-----------------------------------------

Redirect port 80 HTTP to 443 HTTPS

Create the file "/etc/apache2/sites-available/redirect.conf" and copy the text below into it. 

-----------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    Redirect "/" "https://<your grr adminUI url here>"
</VirtualHost>
-----------------------------------------

Reverse Proxy GRR AdminUI Traffic

Create the file "/etc/apache2/sites-available/grr_reverse_proxy.conf" and copy the text below into it. 

-----------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:443>
SSLEngine On
SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/grr_ssl_certificate_filename.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/grr_ssl_certificate_filename.key
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8000/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8000/
</VirtualHost>
-----------------------------------------

Enable the new apache files

-----------------------------------------
a2ensite redirect.conf
a2ensite grr_reverse_proxy.conf
-----------------------------------------

Restart apache

-----------------------------------------
service apache2 restart
-----------------------------------------

* NOTE: This reverse proxy will only proxy the AdminUI. It will have no impact on the agent communications on port 8080. It is advised to restrict access to the AdminUI at the network level.

Scheduling Flows with Cron
--------------------------
The cron allows for scheduling flows to run regularly on the GRR server.
This is currently used to collect statistics and do cleanup on the database.
The cron runs as part of the workers.

Customizing the client
----------------------

The client can be customized for deployment. There are two keys ways of doing
this:

1. Repack the released client with a new configuration.
2. Rebuild the client from scratch (advanced users, set aside a few days the
first time)

Doing a rebuild allows full reconfiguration, changing names and everything else.
A repack on the other hand limits what you can change. Each approach is
described below.

Repacking the Client with a New Configuration.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changing basic configuration parameters can be done by editing the server config
file (/etc/grr/server.local.yaml) to override default values, and then using the
config_updater to repack the binaries.
This allows for changing basic configuration parameters such as the URL
the client reports back to.

Once the config has been edited, you can repack all clients with the new config
and upload them to the datastore using `grr_config_updater repack_clients`

[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
db@host:$ sudo grr_config_updater repack_clients
Using configuration <ConfigFileParser filename="/etc/grr/grr-server.conf">

## Repacking GRR windows amd64 2.5.0.4 client
Packed to /usr/share/grr/executables/windows/installers/GRR_2.5.0.4_amd64.exe

## Uploading

Uploaded to aff4:/config/executables/windows/installers/GRR_2.5.0.4_amd64.exe
db@host:$
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Repacking works by taking the template zip file which are by default installed
to `/usr/share/grr/executables`, injecting relevant configuration files,
and renaming files inside the zip to match requested names. This template is
then turned into something that can be deployed on the system by using the
debian package builder on linux, creating a self extracting zip on Windows, or
creating a DMG on OSX.

After running the repack you should have binaries available in the UI under manage binaries -> installers and also on the filesystem under:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
/usr/share/grr/executables/windows/installers/
/usr/share/grr/executables/osx/installers/
/usr/share/grr/executables/linux/installers/
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Repacking Clients: Signing installer binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use the grr_client_build tool to repack individual templates and control more aspects of the repacking, such as signing. For signing to work you need to follow these instructions:

 - link:linuxclient.adoc#setting-up-for-linux-rpm-signing[Setting up for RPM signing]
 - link:windowsclient.adoc#setting-up-for-windows-exe-signing[Setting up for Windows EXE signing]

Then add the --sign parameter to the repack command:

```
grr_client_build repack --template path/to/grr-response-templates/templates/grr_3.1.0.2_amd64.xar.zip --output_dir=/tmp/test --sign
```

To repack and sign multiple templates at once, see the next section.

Repacking Clients With Custom Labels: Multi-Organization Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each client can have a label "baked in" at build time that allows it to be identified and hunted separately. This is especially useful when you want to deploy across a large number of separate organisations. You achieve this by creating a config file that contains the unique configuration you want applied to the template. A minimal config that just applies a label would contain:

----
Client.labels: [mylabel]
----

and be written into repack_configs/mylabel.yaml.

Then you can call repack_multiple to repack all templates (or whichever templates you choose) with this configuration and any others in the repack_configs directory. An installer will be built for each config:
----
grr_client_build repack_multiple --templates /path/to/grr-response-templates/templates/*.zip --repack_configs /path/to/repack_configs/*.yaml --output_dir=/grr_installers
----

To sign the installers (RPM and EXE), add --sign.

Building the Client.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There's no need to rebuild the client for testing or small deployments, use
link:#repacking-the-client-with-a-new-configuration[repacking] instead.

OS X and Linux clients are built on every commit using travis (after tests pass), and the results are stored on Google cloud storage. Windows templates are link:https://ci.appveyor.com/project/destijl/grr[built on appveyor and the results are downloadable via their website]. You can use these templates directly, but be aware you are trusting the travis and appveyor infrastructure to be secure.

If you want to build your own templates because you have customised code, use the link:https://www.vagrantup.com/[vagrant] build system. You'll need a copy of the GRR source:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/google/grr.git
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and the latest versions of link:https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] and VirtualBox installed. If you reboot the provided linux VM's and get the new kernel you'll need to update the VirtualBox guest additions. You can use link:https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest[vagrant-vbguest] to do this automatically, but you should download and verify the hash on the guest additions yourself (vagrant-vbguest downloads over HTTP and doesn't verify hash).

OS X and windows require some extra work, see here for instructions:

- link:osxclient.adoc[Building the OS X client]
- link:windowsclient.adoc[Building the Windows client]

Once you have your vagrant VMs setup (only necessary for OS X, linux will download VMs automatically), you can build templates for all linux OSes just by running make. If you're building for OS X as well, you'll run this once on linux and once on apple hardware. Windows requires more work as described link:https://github.com/google/grr-doc/blob/master/windowsclient.adoc#building-templates[here].

cd vagrant
make templates
----

To get clean VMs and re-run the provisioning for all linux and OS X VMs you can
use:
----
make vmclean
----

Once you have templates built you need to follow the repacking instructions above to turn them into installers.

Client Configuration.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configuration of the client is done during the packing/repacking of the client.
The process looks like:

.  For the client we are packing, find the correct context and platform,
  e.g. `Platform: Windows` `Client Context`
.  Extract the relevant configuration parameters for that context from the
 server configuration file, and write them to a client specific configuration
 file e.g. `GRR.exe.yaml`
.  Pack that configuration file into the binary to be deployed.

When the client runs, it determines the configuration in the following manner
based on --config and --secondary_configs arguments that are given to it:

.  Read the config file packed with the installer, default:
`c:\windows\system32\GRR\GRR.exe.yaml`
.  GRR.exe.yaml reads the Config.writeback value, default:
`reg://HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/GRR` by default
.  Read in the values at that registry key and override any values from the yaml
file with those values.

Most parameters are able to be modified by changing parameters and then
restarting GRR. However, some configuration options, such as `Client.name`
affect the name of the actual binary itself and therefore can only be changed
with a repack on the server.

Updating a configuration variable in the client can be done in multiple ways:

.  Change the configuration on the server, repack the clients and
redeploy/update them.
.  Edit the yaml configuration file on the machine running the client and
restart the client.
.  Update where Config.writeback points to with new values, e.g. by editing the
registry key.
.  Issue an UpdateConfig flow from the server (not visible in the UI), to
achieve 3.

In practice, you should nearly always do 3 or 4.

As an example, to reduce how often the client polls the server to every 300
seconds, you can update the registry as per below, and then restart the service:

[source,shell]
-------------------------------------------------------------
C:\Windows\System32\>reg add HKLM\Software\GRR /v Client.poll_max /d 300

The operation completed successfully.
C:\Windows\System32\>
-------------------------------------------------------------

Common Client Configuration Options.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The client has numerous configuration parameters that control its behavior, the
following explains some key ones you might want to change:

[horizontal]
Client Behavior Keys:: Keys which affect behavior of the client. Should take
affect on client restart.
Client.poll_max::: Maximum number of seconds between polls to the server.
Client.foreman_check_frequency::: How often to check for foreman jobs (hunts).
Client.rss_max::: Maximum memory for the client to use.
Client.control_urls::: The list of URLs to contact the server on.
Client.proxy_servers::: A list of proxy servers to try.
Logging.verbose::: Enable more verbose logging.
Logging.engines::: Enable or disable syslog, event logs or file logs.
Logging.path::: Where log files get written to.

[horizontal]
Obfuscation Related Keys:: Keys you might want to change to affect obfuscation,
these will require a rebuild.
    Client.name::: The base name of the client. Changing this to Foo will change
    the running binary to Foo.exe and Fooservice.exe on Windows.
    Client.config_key::: The registry key to store config data on Windows
    Client.control_urls::: The list of URLs to contact the server on.
    Client.plist_path::: Where to store the plist on OSX.
    MemoryDriver.display_name::: Description of the service used for the memory
    driver on Windows
    MemoryDriver.service_name::: Name of the service used for the memory driver
    on Windows
    MemoryDriver.install_write_path::: Path to write the memory driver to.
    Nanny.service_name::: Name of the Windows service the nanny runs as.
    Nanny.service_description::: Description of the Windows service the nanny
    runs as.
    ClientBuilder.console::: Affects whether the installer is silent.

For a full list of available options you can run `grr_server --config-help` and
look for `Client`, `Nanny` and `Logging` options.

Deploying The Client
--------------------

For first-time deployment, GRR Clients need to be installed using existing 
package management systems for each platform. For Windows the installer is a 
self-extracting executable which can be deployed using standard tools, such as 
SCCM, but some smaller networks use approaches that require an MSI. In this 
case we suggest using one of the various third-party tools for creating .msi's 
from .exe's, detailed instructions can be found 
link:http://grr-response.blogspot.com/2014/12/wrapping-grr-installers-as-msi-file.html[here].

Deploying Custom Drivers and Code.
----------------------------------
Drivers, binaries or python code can be pushed from the server to the clients
to enable new functionality. This has a number of use cases, such as:

- Upgrades. When you want to update the client you need to be able to push new
code.
- Drivers. If you want to load a driver on the client system to do memory
analysis, you may need a custom driver per system (e.g. in the case of Linux
kernel differences.)
- Protected functionality. If you have code that you want to deploy to deal with
 a specific case, you may not want that to be part of the client, and should
 only be deployed to specific clients.

The code that is pushed from the server must be signed by the corresponding
private key for `Client.executable_signing_public_key` for python and binaries
or the corresponding private key for Client.driver_signing_public_key for
drivers. These signatures will be checked by the client to ensure they match
before the code is used.

What is actually sent to the client is the code or binary wrapped in a protobuf
which will contain a hash, a signature and some other configuration data.

To sign code requires use of config_updater utility. In a secure environment the
signing may occur on a different box from the server, but the examples below
show the basic example.

Deploying Arbitrary Python Code.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To execute an arbitrary python blob, you need to create a file with python code
that has the following attributes:

- Code in the file must work when executed by exec() in the context of a running GRR client.
- Any return data that you want sent back to the server should be stored encoded as a string 
 in a variable called "magic_return_str".

E.g. as a simple example. The following code modifies the clients poll_max
setting and pings test.com.

[source,python]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
import commands
status, output = commands.getstatusoutput("ping -c 3 test.com")
config_lib.CONFIG.Set("Client.poll_max", 100)
config_lib.CONFIG.Write()
magic_return_str = "poll_max successfully set. ping output %s" % output
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file then needs to be signed and converted into the protobuf format
required, and then needs to be uploaded to the data store. You can do this using
the following command line.

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
grr_config_updater upload_python --file=myfile.py --platform=windows
------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of this you should see something like:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uploaded successfully to aff4:/config/python_hacks/myfile.py
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The uploaded files live by convention in aff4:/config/python_hacks and are
viewable in the Manage Binaries section of the Admin UI.

The ExecutePythonHack Flow is provided for executing the file on a client.

NOTE: Specifying arguments to a PythonHack is possible as well through the
py_args argument, this can be useful for making the hack more generic.


Deploying Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drivers are currently used in memory analysis. By default we use drivers
developed and released by the Rekall team named "pmem". We currently have Apache
Licensed, tested drivers for OSX, Linux and Windows. GRR Does not currently 
support loading drivers which are not designed to work with Rekall.

The drivers are distributed with GRR but are also available from the Rekall
project site in binary form at http://www.rekall-forensic.com/. (To extract 
just the drivers you can just unzip them from the winpmem binary itself).

Deploying a driver works much the same as deploying python code. We sign the
file, encode it in a protobuf and upload it to a specific place in the GRR
datastore. There is a shortcut to upload the memory drivers shipped with GRR
using config updater. This will place the drivers shipped with GRR from their 
default locations into the expected location.

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
db@host: ~$ sudo grr_config_updater load_memory_drivers
Using configuration <ConfigFileParser filename="/etc/grr/grr-server.conf">
uploaded aff4:/config/drivers/darwin/memory/osxpmem
uploaded aff4:/config/drivers/windows/memory/winpmem.32.sys
uploaded aff4:/config/drivers/windows/memory/winpmem.64.sys
db@host:$
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If this worked you should now see them under Manage Binaries in the Admin UI.

If you need to add a new driver or add a custom install you can use the 
upload memory driver functionality:

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
db@host:~$ sudo grr_config_updater upload_memory_driver --file=/path/to/my_special_pmem.kext.tgz --platform=windows --arch amd64 --dest aff4:/config/drivers/osx/memory/pmem
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need to customize some property of the driver you can easily inject configuration parameters into the above command line (this _must_ be done before the `upload_memory_driver` command). For example, if you recompiled the driver to present a different device name on the client:

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
db@host:~$ sudo grr_config_updater -pMemoryDriver.device_path=/dev/my_pmem_device upload_memory_driver --file=/path/to/my_special_pmem.kext.tgz --platform=windows  --arch amd64 --dest aff4:/config/drivers/osx/memory/pmem
------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE: The signing we discuss here is independent of Authenticode driver signing,
which is also required by modern 64 bit Windows distributions.

Deploying this driver would normally be done using the LoadMemoryDriver flow.


Building a Linux memory driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determine the kernel version of the system the GRR client is running on e.g.
----
3.13.0-49-generic
----

Find a reprentative build machine e.g. Ubuntu and install the corresponding
kernel headesr:
----
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.13.0-49-generic
----

Clone rekall and traverse into the linux driver source directory:
----
git clone https://github.com/google/rekall.git
cd rekall/tools/linux
----

edit Makefile and set KVER to the kernel version
----
KVER ?= "3.13.0-49-generic
----

Build the pmem driver:
----
make pmem
----

Deploy pmem.ko as a driver.


Deploying Executables.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GRR Agent provides an ExecuteBinaryCommand Client Action which allows us to
send a binary and set of command line arguments to be executed. The binary must
be signed using the executable signing key (config option
PrivateKeys.executable_signing_private_key).

To sign an exe for execution use the config updater script.

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
db@host:$ grr_config_updater upload_exe --file=/tmp/bazinga.exe -platform=windows
Using configuration <ConfigFileParser filename="/etc/grr/grr-server.conf">
Uploaded successfully to /config/executables/windows/installers/bazinga.exe
db@host:$
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This uploads to the installers directory by default. But you can override with
the --dest_path option.

This file can then be executed with the LaunchBinary flow which is in the Administrative flows if Advanced Mode is enabled. 


Client Robustness Mechanisms
----------------------------
We have a number of mechanisms built into the client to try and ensure it has
sensible resource requirements, doesn't get out of control, and doesn't
accidentally die. We document them here.

Heart beat
~~~~~~~~~~
The client process regularly writes to a registry key (file on Linux and OSX)
with a timer. The nanny process watches this registry key called HeartBeat, if
it notices that the the client hasn't updated the heartbeat in the time
allocated by UNRESPONSIVE_KILL_PERIOD (default 3 minutes), the nanny will assume
the client has hung and will kill it. In Windows we then rely on the Nanny to
revive it, on Linux and OSX we rely on the service handling mechanism to do so.

Transaction log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the client is about to start an action it writes to a registry key
containing information about what it is about to do. If the client dies while
performing the action, when the client gets restarted it will send an error
along with the data from the transaction log to help diagnose the issue.

One tricky thing with the transaction log is the case of Bluescreens or kernel
panics. Writing to the transaction log will write a registry key on Windows,
but registry keys are not flushed to disk immediately. Therefore, writing a
transaction log, and then getting a hard BlueScreen or kernel panic, the
transaction log won't be persistent, and therefore the error won't be sent.
We work around this by adding a Flush to the transaction log when we are about
to do dangerous transactions, such as loading a memory driver. But if the client
dies during a transaction we didn't deem as dangerous, it is possible that you
will not get a crash report.

Memory limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have a hard and a soft memory limit built into the client to stop it getting
out of control. The hard limit is enforced by the nanny, if the client goes over
that limit it will be hard killed. The soft limit is enforced by the client, if
the limit is exceeded the client will stop retrieving new work to do. Once it
has finished its current work it will die cleanly.

Default soft limit is 500MB, but GRR should only use about 30MB. Some volatility
plugins can use a lot of memory so we try to be generous. Hard limit is double
the soft limit. This is configurable from the config file.

CPU limit
~~~~~~~~~
A ClientAction can be transmitted from the server with a specified CPU limit,
this is how many seconds the action can use. If the action uses more than that
it will be killed.
The actual implementation is a little more complicated. An action can run for 3
minutes using any CPU it wants before being killed by nanny. However actions
that are good citizens (normally the dangerous ones) will call the Progress()
function regularly. This function checks if limit has been exceeded and will
exit.

Building the Server Debian package
----------------------------------

These instructions are really only for GRR devs making a release. In most cases users will want to follow the link:https://github.com/google/grr-doc/blob/master/installfrompip.adoc#installing-grr-server-for-dev-ie-tracking-head[Installing GRR server for Dev] instructions if you have made server customizations, rather than rebuild the debian package.

Build the package using docker as below. This first command builds the docker image, which includes the deb, and the second command starts a container and copies out the package files into the current directory. 

----
docker build -t build_package -f docker/Dockerfile.build_server_deb .
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/output:rw -u $(id -u) build_package bash -c "cp -r /usr/src/grr-server* /output/"
----

Note this uses dh_virtualenv and installs the released grr packages from pypi. To install a different version or test for release, build sdists for all the grr python packages and put them in a directory, then modify debian/rules as specified in the file to point to the local directory.

We want to run this as a dockerhub build on every commit, but are link:https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/292[blocked by dockerhub's inability to separate context and Dockerfile]. We'd also need to build sdist's for all of the GRR packages.

Crashes
-------
The client shouldn't ever crash... but it does because making software is hard.
There are a few ways in which this can happen, all of which we try and catch,
record and make visible to allow for debugging. In the UI they are visible in
two ways, in "Crashes" when a client is selected, and in "All Client Crashes".
These have the same information but the client view only shows crashes for the
specific client.

Each crash should contain the reason for the crash, optionally it may contain
the flow or action that caused the crash. In some cases this information is not
available because the client may have crashed when it wasn't doing anything or
in a way where we could not tie it to the action. See
xref:_client_robustness_mechanisms[Client Robustness Mechanisms] for a
discussion of this.

This data is also emailed to the email address configured in the config as
Monitoring.alert_email

Crash Types
~~~~~~~~~~~

Crashed while executing an action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Often seen with an error "Client killed during transaction". This means that
while handling a specific action, the client died, the nanny knows this because
the client recorded the action it was about to take in the Transaction Log
before starting it. When the client restarts it picks up this log and notifies
the server of the crash. 

Causes

* Client segfaults, could happen in native code such Sleuth Kit or psutil.
* Hard reboot while the machine was running an action where the client service didn't have a chance to exit cleanly.

Unexpected child process exit!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This means the client exited, but the nanny didn't kill it.

Causes

* Uncaught exception in python, very unlikely due to the fact that we catch
Exception for all client actions.


Memory limit exceeded, exiting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This means the client exited due to exceeding the soft memory limit.

Causes

* Client hits the soft memory limit. Soft memory limit is when the client knows
it is using too much memory but will continue operation until it finishes what
it is doing.

Nanny Message - No heartbeat received
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This means that the Nanny killed the client because it didn't receive a
Heartbeat within the allocated time.

Causes

* The client has hung, e.g. locked accessing network file
* The client is performing an action that is taking longer than it should.

Notifiying Users of Updates or Issues via the GUI
-------------------------------------------------
GRR has the ability to display a notification similar to the yellow link:http://www.chromium.org/user-experience/infobars[Chrome Infobar]. This can be useful if you need to let users know about new functionality, updates, problems, downtime etc. For now it requires console access to set a new notification.

----
flow.GRRFlow.StartFlow(flow_name="SetGlobalNotification", type="WARNING", content="NOTE: This is a one-time warning. To hide this message click on X in the right corner of this panel.", link="http://company.com/moreinfo", token=access_control.ACLToken(username="myuser"))
----

To remove all notifications:
