***Note on the AFF4 datastore deprecation***

*Starting from the version ***3.3.0.0*** GRR uses a new datastore format by default - ***REL_DB***. REL_DB is backwards-incompatible with the now-deprecated AFF4 datastore format (even though they both use MySQL as a backend).*

*Use of AFF4-based deployments is now discouraged. REL_DB is expected to be much more stable and performant. Please see [these docs](../maintaining-and-tuning/grr-datastore.md) if you're upgrading an older GRR version and would like to try out the new datastore.*

# Installing from a release server deb (recommended)

This is the recommended way of installing the GRR server components. GRR server
debs are built for Ubuntu Xenial. They may install on Debian or other Ubuntu
versions, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

1. MySQL is GRR's default database backend, and should be up and running
before installing GRR. The database framework can be run alongside GRR on the
same machine, or on a remote machine. Here's how you would install the
community edition of MySQL from Ubuntu repositories:

    ```bash
    apt install -y mysql-server
    ```

    If you have never installed MySQL on the machine before, you will be
    prompted for a password for the 'root' database user. After installation
    completes, you will typically want to create a new database
    user for GRR and give that user access an empty database that
    the GRR server installation will use:

    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p
    ```

    ```bash
    mysql> CREATE USER 'grr'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE grr;

    mysql> GRANT ALL ON grr.* TO 'grr'@'localhost';
    ```
    Creation of a new user is optional though since GRR can use the credentials
    of the root user to connect to MySQL.

2. Download the latest server deb from <https://github.com/google/grr/releases>:

    ```bash
    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/releases.grr-response.com/grr-server___GRR_DEB_VERSION___amd64.deb
    ```

3. Install the server deb, along with its dependencies, like below:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y ./grr-server___GRR_DEB_VERSION___amd64.deb
    ```

    The installer will prompt for a few pieces of information to get things set up.
    After successful installation, the `grr-server` service should be running:

    ```bash
    root@grruser-xenial:/home/grruser# systemctl status grr-server
    ‚óè grr-server.service - GRR Service
       Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/grr-server.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

    ```

    In addition, administrative commands for GRR, e.g `grr_console` and
    `grr_config_updater` should be available in your PATH.
